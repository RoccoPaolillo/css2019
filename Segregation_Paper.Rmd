# Extended Abstract

Research on patterns of neighborhood ethnic segregation in the UK and, more generally, in the European context, has been very much dominated by the exploration of segregation indices (Catney 2017; Simpson 2004). While these studies are of great importance for describing the changes in the spatial distribution of ethnic minorities over time—and new methodologies have improved their calculation (Johnston et al. 2016)—they are limited first, in their ability to disentangle the mechanisms behind those changes, and second, in their capacity to predict how neighborhood ethnic segregation might evolve over time. Using aggregated census and register data from selected English cities, this study presents and discusses two alternative (and complementary) methodological approaches that address this concern. These approaches consider, in different ways, three explanatory mechanisms that have been highlighted by the literature: ethnic groups’ socioeconomic resources and how they interact with housing prices and residential structures; discrimination in the housing market; and individuals’ preferences to live close to members of the same group (Logan and Alba 1993). Specifically, we ask: first, what factors are associated to an increase in neighborhood ethnic segregation (or decrease thereof) in the UK? Second, how might segregation evolve should these mechanisms persist over time; or conversely, how could segregation reduce?

The first methodological approach considers hierarchical Bayesian spatial models of segregation (Anselin 1995) to predict observed segregation patterns.  Specifically, we investigate the behavior of local indices of segregation (2001-2011)—that is, indices that are able to classify each spatial unit in a city—with aggregated information obtained for the same spatial units in 2001. This methodology allows identifying macro-level factors associated to the observed segregation patterns; in addition, an advantage is that it allows taking into consideration the spatial autocorrelation of data, that is, the fact that contiguous spatial units are more similar to each other in their levels of spatial segregation. Preliminary analyses predicting the local spatial entropy index (a local measure of ethnic diversity)  in the city of Bradford, show that an increase in housing prices tended to de-segregate areas, making them more homogenous in terms of the ethnic-racial composition of the population, whereas certain characteristics of the population (in terms of age structures, proportion of highly educated and proportion singles) tended to increase segregation at the local level. 

The second methodological approach is based on agent-based models and, more specifically, on an improved version of Schelling’s model of segregation. Schelling (1971) showed that individuals’ preferences for in-group members—as well as their “thresholds of tolerance”—play a key role in spatial segregation. We add another key predictor of neighborhood choice: individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics (Crowder, South, and Chavez 2006).  Specifically, we first discuss the combined role of individuals’ preferences for co-ethnics and their socioeconomic status, and what the implications of this might be for Shelling’s theoretical model; next, we implement this improved model in selected cities in England, under the assumption that the role of socioeconomic  assets on neighborhood choice varies across ethnic groups (Zuccotti 2019; Coulter and Clark 2018). Preliminary results show that…

The paper concludes with an overview of the key mechanisms associated to neighborhood ethnic segregation in the UK, as well as with a discussion of the benefits and limitations of both methodologies for the study of neighborhood segregation.

We use census data from ..SOURCE.. from the years 2011 and 2001. 
We use LSOAs (Lower Layer Super Output Areas) of towns in England. 
These are ... towns (with population between ... and ...).
Each town has between ... and ... LSOAs. 
Each LSOA has between 1,000 and 1,500 inhabitants (that is the census goal, check real data). 
For each LSOA we extracted the contingency tables for the population with respect to four groups of ethnicities and three groups of socio-economic status. 
Reasons why we focus on towns as the upper level unit of observation. 

The ethnicty groups are composed of the following groups:

  * WHITEB (White British): ...
  * ASIAN: ... 
  * BLACK: ...
  * OTHER: ... 

Give some reasons why we use this classification. Why are Chinese in Asians although they would not consider themselves as similar, same with Indians and Pakistani? What about the black? What about other? What about Irish?
The reasons lie in a mix of 

  * data availability
  * defining not too small groups which are likely to consider themselves as from similar ethnicity based on simple  criteria which can be recognized by a visit to the district when searching a house. 
  * common practices
  
The socio-economic status (SES) is extracted from NSSEC (..SOURCE..) to the following three classes

  * LOW: Classes 5, 6, and 7
  * MID: Classes 3 and 4
  * HIGH: Classes 1 and 2

The classification of SES excludes the class 8 ("Never worked and long-term unemployed"). 
Further on, the cross-tabulation includes only the population between 16 and 74 (CHECK was there a reason in the data for this?). 

With this restriction, the population used in our study deviates slightly from the total population (which includes children, very old people, and class 8), but it focusses on the part of the population which mostly considered to be able to do independent decisions of relocation. 

Finally we end up with a dataset which delivers us the population number for twelve mutually exclusive groups:

  * WHITEB_LOW, WHITEB_MID, WHITEB_HIGH
  * ASIAN_LOW, ASIAN_MID, ASIAN_HIGH
  * BLACK_LOW, BLACK_MID, BLACK_HIGH
  * OTHER_LOW, OTHER_MID, OTHER_HIGH

For the cross tabulation we can extract the margin population numbers for each ethnicity WHITEB, ASIAN, BLACK, and OTHER and each SES group LOW, MID, HIGH, as well as the total population (excluding children, very old and class 8). 

For the spatial information of LSOAs we used the GIS data Lower_Layer_Super_Output_Areas_December_2011_Boundaries_EW_BSC provided by ..SOURCE.. (and 2001??)
This dataset provides shapefiles with a low resolution for every LSOA. 
The low resolution is sufficient because with our modeling purposes we are mostly interested in the neighborhood relations and rough distances of regional units. 
For each town of interest we joined demographic and the geograhic data in one dataset. 

We can now use the population numbers on the LSOA level to compute the same numbers for higher level regional units, e.g. 

  * the population statistics of one LSOA and all its neighboring LSOAs (using the GIS operation of selecting regions which share at least a part of the boundaries)
  * the population statistics of the whole town. 
  
In the following, we index count values of the contingency tables as $N_i^{X,Y}$ where subscripts index the LSOA, the first superscript the ethnicity and the second the SES. In our case, $X \in \text{Eth} = \{\text{WHITEB},\text{ASIAN},\text{BLACK},\text{OTHER}\}$ and $Y \in \text{SES} = \{\text{LOW},\text{MID},\text{HIGH}\}$. Margin total counts for a particular town are thus defined as:

  * $N^{X,\cdot}_i = \sum_{Y\in\text{SES}} N_i^{X,Y}$ and $N^{X,\cdot}_i = \sum_{X\in\text{Eth}} N_i^{X,\cdot}$ where we abbriviate $N^X_i := N^{X,\cdot}_i$ and $N^Y_i := N^{X,\cdot}_i$ when the superscript index label or the context make it clear if we speak of ethnicity or SES. 
  * $N_i = \sum_{X \in \text{Eth}, Y \in \text{SES}} N_i^{X,Y}$
  * $N^X = \sum_{i,X\in\text{Eth}} N_i^{X}$, $N^Y = \sum_{i,Y\in\text{SES}} N_i^{Y}$
  * $N = \sum_{i} N_i = \sum_{X\in\text{Eth}} N^{X} = \sum_{Y\in\text{SES}} N^{Y} = \sum_{i,X\in\text{Eth},Y\in\text{SES}} N_i^{X}$

We define fractions of population in an analog way, where 

  * $P_i^{X,Y} = N_i^{X,Y}/N_i$
  * $P_i^X = N_i^X/N_i$, $P_i^Y = N_i^Y/N_i$
  * $P^X = N^X/N$, $P^Y = N^Y/N$
  
(Note: It may also turnout useful to compute fractions of Ethncities for each SES and vice versa on the LSOA or town level, e.g. $N_i^{X,Y}/N^X_i$ for SES $Y$ or $N_i^{X,Y}/N^X_i$ for ethnicity $X$. This is not covered in the logic applied above, where we assume the the fraction is always with respect to the total of the geographic unit only. )

# Segregation measures

Based on the dataset we can compute several segregation measures on the levels of the LSOA and of the town

These are group-based measures 

  * fractions for each ethnicity (4 measures $P^X_i$, $P^X$)
  * fractions for each SES group (3 measures $P^Y_i$, $P^Y$)
  * fractions for each ethnicty-SES group (12 measures $P^{X,Y}_i$)
  * location quotients (for LSOAs only) showing how much higher (or lower) the fraction of a group is proportionally compared to the town level ($P^X_i/P^X$)
  * dissimilarity for LSOA showing the absolute deviation of the fraction of the group from the town level ($\frac{| P_i^X - P^X|}{2 P^X(1 - P^X)}$)
  * dissimilarity for the town, showing the population weighted average of dissimilarity of the LSOA level for the group ($\sum_i \frac{N_i}{N} \frac{|P_i^X - P^X|}{2 P^X(1 - P^X)}$, this is by definition between zero and one). 
  
and Segregation indices
  
  * local Simpson index (on town and LSOA level) showing the probability that two randomly selected individuals are from the same group ($\sum_X {P_i^X}^2$ and $\sum_X {P^X}^2$, this is the index used in theoretical studies of  Schelling's model)
  * local entropy index (on town and LSOA level) showing how diverse the ethnic mix in the region is ($- \frac{1}{\log \#\text{Eth}}\sum_{X\in\text{Eth}} P_i^X \cdot \log P_i^X$ and $- \frac{1}{\log \#\text{Eth}}\sum_{X\in\text{Eth}} P^X \cdot \log P^X$, mathematically and empirically very similar to one minus the local Simpson index)
  * average local Simpson index on the town level ($\sum_i \frac{N_i}{N}\sum_X {P_i^X}^2$)
  * average local entropy index on the town level ($- \frac{1}{\log \#\text{Eth}}\sum_i \frac{N_i}{N} \sum_{X\in\text{Eth}} P_i^X \cdot \log P_i^X$)
  * excess average local Simpson index (this measures how much higher the average local index is compared to index in the town as a whole, $(\sum_i \frac{N_i}{N}\sum_X {P_i^X}^2) - \sum_X {P^X}^2$)
  * loss of average local entropy index (this measures how much lower the average local index is compared to the index of the town as a whole, $- \frac{1}{\log \#\text{Eth}}\sum_{X\in\text{Eth}} P^X \cdot \log P^X + \frac{1}{\log \#\text{Eth}}\sum_i \frac{N_i}{N} \sum_{X\in\text{Eth}} P_i^X \cdot \log P_i^X$)
  
TODO: Decide which indicators to use for what. For Simpson we need to check which is the least 


# Outline of Analysis

## Hypothesis from Theory

Mechanisms for segregation form sociological theories.   

Spatial Assimilation Theory ->   
Predictions: Diversity Measures should decrease over time because ethnic similarity matters less and less for individuals, this happens presumably more for high SES minorities ->   
With the ABM we can (1) test if find less segregation in high SES in some reasonable parameter configuration to offer an alternative explanation, and/or (2) do counterfactual studies what happens when we lower the average threshold or lower the beta_ethn (the weight for ethnic similarity in the utility function), perhaps we find some counterintuitive non-linear effects that e.g. segregation need not necessarily decrease for all groups when one of these to processes happen. 

SES matters also for prevents full segregation ->

## Spatial Regression

## Agent-based dynamical model

We built an agent-based model of residential relocation within a town where we specify agents and space based on its geography and demographic data. In the model, each *agent* is demographically specified by *ethnicity* ("WHITEB", "ASIAN", "BLACK", or "OTHER"), *socio-economic status* ("LOW", "MID", or "HIGH"), and an individual *threshold* value which quantifies the minimal fractions of similar neighbors the agents needs to perceive positive utility from their residence. The *neighborhood* of the agent is the district of residence and to a lesser degree the neighboring districts. The *districts* in the model are the LSOA's of the town in their geographic location and districts are neighboring when they share a border.

An agent's *decision to relocate* is modeled as a two-step process. First, the agent assesses the utility of their current residence. When utility is positive the agent stays at the current residence and the second step is skipped. When utility is negative the agent selects a potential new residence in the town randomly from all available places. Second, the agent assesses the utility of this option. The agent moves to the district of the new residence if the utility of this district is larger than the utility at the current residence. That way a free residence is created in the district the  agent is leaving. With the two-step process we unite two traditions of relocation models. In Schelling's original model [-@schelling1969models;-@schelling1971dynamic] agents only make a decision two leave and move to a random new place without checking if this improves their utility. In most models implementing discrete choice within Schelling's framework [@bruch2006neighborhood;@bruch2009preferences;@xie2012modeling], agents always compare their current residence with other options even if their current utility is very high.^[In the model, we provide further parameters to switch the two steps of the relocation decision on and off. When the first step is off, agents always search for an alternative location. When the second step is off agents always move to the selected alternative without checking if it has higher utility. These can be used for robustness tests.]

Formally, an agent with ethnicity $X$, socio-economic status $Y$, and threshold $\theta$ computes *utility* for a residence in district $i$ as 
$$ U_{X,Y,\theta}(i) = \underbrace{\beta_\text{Eth} (P_i^X - \theta) + \beta_\text{SES} (P_i^Y - \theta)}_{\text{observable utility}} + \varepsilon$$
where $P_i^X$ is the *fraction of the population with the same ethnicity*, $P_i^Y$ the *fraction of the population with the same socio-economic status*, and $\varepsilon$ is *unobservable utility* of the agent. The population the agent takes into account is the population in district $i$ and the population in neighboring districts to a lesser degree, weighted by the parameter *neighbor-weight*. In step one of the relocation decision, the agent decides to search when $U_{X,Y,\theta}(i) < 0$. In step two, the agent selects a districts $j$ to potentially move to. The selection is random with probabilities proportional to the number of the free residences over all districts. The agent relocates to district $j$ when $U_{X,Y,\theta}(j) > U_{X,Y,\theta}(i)$.

Utility increases linearly with $P_i^X$ as well as with $P_i^Y$. Thus, both similarities can compensate each other. Low similarity in ethnicity can be compensated by high socio-economic similarity. The parameters $\beta_\text{Eth}$ and $\beta_\text{SES}$ specifiy the importance of ethnic and respectively socio-economic similarity. The higher the threshold $\theta$ the larger is the tendency that utility becomes negative. Individuals with a high threshold thus have a higher tendency to search an alternative residence in step one of the decision to relocate. In step two of the relocation decision, agents prefer alternatives with either more ethnic similarity or more socio-economic similarity or both. When, e.g., $\beta_\text{SES} > \beta_\text{Eth}$ a small increase in socio-economic similarity can outweigh even a slightly larger decrease in ethnic similarity. 

In our particular case, it is reasonable to treat the ethnic group OTHER differently because they represent much more diverse groups of the population than WHITEB, ASIAN, or BLACK. They will perceive themselves as similars to a much lower degree. Therefore, we set $\beta_\text{Eth} = 0$ when  $X=$ OTHER.^[The model includes an additional parameter to switch the different behavior of OTHERs on and off. When off, OTHERs are treated as a normal ethnic group.] TO DECIDE AND CHANGE: WHEN WE TREAT OTHER DIFFERENTLY IT IS MORE CONSISTENT TO ALSO COMPUTE THE SIMPSON INDEX ACCORDINGLY: THE TERM $(P_i^\text{OTHER})^2$ CAN BE OMITTED. BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT ASSUME TWO RANDOMLY SELECTED PEOPLE FROM THIS GROUP AS SIMILAR. IF WE DO THIS, THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR ALL ANALYSES! EMPIRICALLY, I SEE ONLY VERY SMALL CHANGES, SO IT MAY NOT CHANGE MUCH OF THE RESULTS. 

*Unobservable utility* $\varepsilon$ is a random variable, analogous to error term in regression models. This is a standard in discrete choices that subscribe to random utility, assuming that people might not always select the best option based on observable utility, for whatever reason, still assuming a preference for utility maximization [@hess2018revisiting;@train2009discrete]. This is a well-established approach in empirical studies of residential mobility [@frankhauser2016deciding;@boschman2015neighbourhood], and in recent years used in Schelling-type simulations for sake of realistic decisions and assumptions on people's preferences [@bruch2012methodological;@bruch2009preferences]. Whenever utility is assessed, a random number for $\varepsilon$ is drawn from a standard Gumbel distribution.^[The standard Gumbel distribution is also known as generalized extreme value distribution type-I and has a mean of 0.577 (Euler-Masceroni constant) and a standard deviation of 1.283 ($\pi/\sqrt 6$)). Thus, when observed utility is zero in step one of the relocation decision, the probability to search is only 0.368. The probability to search is 0.5 for an observed utility of 0.367. In step two of the relocation decision, two random numbers are drawn, one for each alternative. The difference of two random variables with standard Gumbel distribution has a logistic distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 3.29 ($\pi^2/3$).] The lower $\beta_\text{Eth}$ and $\beta_\text{SES}$ are, the more the random contribution of unobserved utility has a stronger impact. 

We implemented the model in NetLogo [@wilenskynl] and made it freely available UPDATE LINK END.^[The model is availabel at https://github.com/RoccoPaolillo/css2019.git] 
The interface is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:NetLogoInterface). 
Clicking "Load town" in the interface section "1. Load Town from GIS Data" initializes a simulation by loading the LSOA shapes of a town using NetLogo's GIS extension. The GIS data includes population data for each district. REFER TO DESCRIPTIVES SECTION ON POPULATION DATA. Summary statistics of the whole town are shown in the output window. From the population data a set of agents is created in each district. Agents are initialized with ethnicity and socio-economic status according to population data. Further on, each agent draws the threshold $\theta$ from a Beta distribution with mean $\mu_\theta$ and standard $\sigma_\theta$. These are two global parameters of the model quantifying level and dispersion of individual thresholds. Finally, the maximal population is set for each district upon initialization.^[The maximal population is set based on the *free-space* parameter which quantifies the fraction of free places compared to the initial population. The maximal population is set once for the whole population for each district and once for each socio-economic status group. The latter allows to tie houses to agents with a specific socio-economic status which is an option that can be switched on and off at runtime.]  
The population data can be visually explored on the central map using the switches, choosers and sliders in the section "2. Explore Local Data". Several basic, segregation specific and other measures are available. Many are for speciific ethnic or socio-economic groups or both.

The main purpose of the agent-based model is to study the emergence of segregation patterns in towns which are not segregated. To that end, the population can be *shuffled* (using the button in section "3. Setup Simulation") to create a counter-factual situation in which each district shows the same composition of ethnicities as the whole town. All our simulation experiments shuffle the population as part of the initialization procedure. Shuffling keeps the geography of districts, the total decomposition of the population into ethnicity and socio-economic groups, and the  The shuffling procedure takes the parameter *tie-houses-to-SES* into account.^[When tie-houses-to-SES is switched on, the districts of the shuffled town keep the distribution of socio-economic groups. When switched off, also socio-economic groups are locally distributed as in the whole town after shuffling.] As a consequence, the dissimilarity for all ethnicities and the average local Simpson Index are maximally low.

Clicking "Go" in the interface section "4. Run Simulation" starts a *simulation run*. Further on, the section provides the global parameters from the utility functions $\beta_\text{Eth}$ and $\beta_\text{SES}$ which can be changed at runtime. 
Once "Go" is clicked, the simulation runs one tick after the other. In each tick, agents are picked at random and perform the two step decision to relocate as described above. The total number of agents' decisions per ticks matches the total number of agents. Thus, a tick represents a unit time step. 

The interface section "5. Outcomes Simulation vs. Empricial" shows the current distribution of the measure as selected in section 2 in comparison with the emprical distribution. Further on, time trends are shown for the Simpson Index and the Dissimilarity Index for all ethnicities as well as the fraction of agents who searched for an alternative and those who actually moved. The interface also provides further parameters for robustness tests.

<!-- We explored the model focussing on Bradford and concluded with the following baseline parameters: For the threshold distribution the mean is $\mu_\theta = 0.3$ and standard deviation $\sigma_\theta = 0.1$. In the utility function the weights are $\beta_\text{Eth} = 6$ and $\beta_\text{SES} = 12$. Further on, houses in the model are tied to individuals from the same SES (`tie-houses-to-ses = TRUE`).  -->

<!-- The other parameters were not the focus of the model exploration. They were set to `free-space` of 0.05 more than initial population and a weight for neighboring districts when calculating the fraction of neighbors' ethnicities of `neighbor-weight` = 0.17. We will briefly discuss the impact of other values later.  -->

<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:BradfordBaseline) shows the fractions of the four ethnic groups in all LSOA's as it emerged in simulation in comparison with the empirical data. For each ethnic group two maps are shown as well as the distributions of the fractions over all LSOA's in for direct comparison. The simulation data emerged after 2,000 time steps from a shuffled population such that ethnicity shares in each district were equal to the ethnic.  -->

<!-- The figure shows a remarkable similarity between the simulation and empirical data with respect to the distribution of the fraction of ethnic groups over all districts. This works for all three ethnic groups and even fairly well for the OTHERs. The spatial patterns are also similar with, e.g., two to three clusters of almost only ASIANs surrounded by diverse LSOAs. Only the exact location of clusters is not reproduced as in the empirical map. This could not be expected as the simulation starts from equalized districts and the only remaining demographic information is the distribution of houses for the three socio-economic status groups.  -->

<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:Simpson) shows the excess local Simpson index of districts. That means how much less or more diverse districts are compared to the towns overall Simpson index.  -->

<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:Differences) shows that just having ethnicity preferences in the utility function would lead to almost full segragation of Asians (and of other ethnicities, but not shown), while only SES in the utility function does not trigger any substantial ethnic segregation. Further on, it shows that equal importance of ethnicity and SES similarity in the utility function would still lead to over segregation.  -->

<!-- Another interesting finding is that average SES of minority ethnicities is empirically more unequal than the average SES of the white British. This is especially the case for high average SES. The simulation shows that this is also an emergent property in our model as shown in Figure \@ref{fig:AverageSES}.  -->

Notes 


Model usage:   
For the purpose of simulation speed all population counts can be scaled down by the factor `scale-down-pop`. We used a scale-down of factor 10 after extensively testing that it shows no recognizable difference. 

Further topics to be discussed as extensions or robustness tests listed under "Further parameters:   
  - Turnover (replaces what was called forced moves before).
  - Version were individuals do not decide if they want to move but always search for an option and move if the found place is better. 
  - Treat the ethnicity OTHER not a normal ethnicity and not as ignoring the fraction of ethnicities. 


  - Baseline setting, start simulation form original data initial conditions. Result: It increases to higher segregation levels. So, the exact empirical situation is not close to be stochastically stable (although the situation emerging from shuffled population is close to stochastically stable and close to empirical data on macroscopic measures. ). Discuss potential trends and shortcomings of the model. )
  - Baseline setting check impact of `neighbor-weight`. Show `neighbor-weight` = 1 and 0.
  - Baseline setting check impact of `free-space`. Show 0.01 and 0.4. Result: This mainly confines people more or less to keep the SES structure. With higher `free-space` people can realize more of similarity with respect to SES and thus produce less segregation based on ethnicity (but more with respect to SES).
